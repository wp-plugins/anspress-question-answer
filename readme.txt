**Page Shortcodes**

Use this shortcode in base to AnsPress work properly
`[anspress]`


== Installation ==

Its very easy to install the plugin.

* Install plugin (WP -> Plugins -> Install new -> Anspress)
* Activate plugin (Plugins -> Installed Plugins -> Activate)
* Create an AnsPress page (mine had done it automatically, but incase it doesnt) Pages -> Add New -> Type [anspress] in the page and publish (the name can be changed to whatever you like, but there must be `[anspress]` shortcode in content.
* Add AnsPress links in your menu, Appearance -> Menus, and then drag AnsPress links in your menu, and save.
* Your page should have the Ask, Categories, Tags, Users etc wherever you placed your menu!


= Page Template =

As AnsPress output its content based on shortcode, so you must edit you page template to avoid double title. So create a page template without title and set it for AnsPress base page. or simply create a page template with this name `page-YOUR_BASE_PAGE_ID.php`. Change the YOUR_BASE_PAGE_ID to the id of the base page.

That's all. enjoy :)
